<p>
A fictional model of student clique formation on playgrounds.  Students form a social network of varying degrees 
of mutual friendship or dislike.  Once let out of school, students try to move towards friends and away from enemies
.  Additional forces tug on students to keep them near near the schoolhouse (the center of the yard), and to add som
e randomness.  Students change from red to blue as they become happier with their situation.
