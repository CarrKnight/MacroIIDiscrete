/** A Controller is the top-level object responsible for setting up and running the GUIState.
    More or less, the Controller calls the init, start, adjust, finish, and quit methods on the GUIState.
    The Controller also provides a window management facility.  The controller allows the GUIState to register
    windows to appear in a list to the user and to be closed properly when the program is quit.  The controller
    also manages a repository of current inspectors.  Both of these facilities are optional.  Subclasses
    are not required to implement all these methods; they can stub some out except for doChangeCode(...).

        fashion.
        
        <p>You have other options for updating the model from external threads.  One option is to add
        a Steppable to GUIState's scheduleImmediate(...) queue.  When the Steppable is stepped, it will
        be done so inside the model's thread.  This is asynchronous (non-blocking), however.
        
        <p>Alternatively, you can synchronize on state.schedule and run your code.  This is synchronous.
