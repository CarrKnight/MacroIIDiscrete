/**
 * An implementation of the first exercise from the book An Introduction to Genetic
 * Algorithms, by Melanie Mitchell.  The algorithm evolves bit strings and the
 * fitness function simply counts the number of ones in the bit string.  The evolution
 * should therefore converge on strings that consist only of ones.
