/**
 * <h4>Description</h4>
 * <p/> Department refers to any subcomponent for a firm. So far we have PurchaseDepartments, SalesDepartment and HumanResources.
 * They don't really share an interface or any commonality, so this interface is basically an annotation. It's useful in registering quotes when I want to specify which
 * department generated such quotes.
